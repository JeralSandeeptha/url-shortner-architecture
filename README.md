# 🧠 Software Architecture Repository

This repository contains the complete **software architecture documentation** for the project, including system design artifacts, architectural decisions, and deployment details.  
It serves as a **single source of truth** for understanding the system’s structure, behavior, and rationale behind design choices.

---

## 📘 Contents

### 1. **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**
- Defines the project’s purpose, scope, and objectives.  
- Includes detailed **functional and non-functional requirements**.  
- Serves as a reference for development, QA, and future scaling decisions.

### 2. **System Architecture**
- High-level system design and component interactions.  
- Includes:
  - Architectural diagrams (C4 model / UML)
  - Technology stack overview
  - Data flow and API design
  - Integration and communication patterns

### 3. **Kubernetes (K8s) Configuration**
- Deployment and infrastructure setup for containerized services.  
- Includes:
  - Deployment manifests
  - Services, Ingress, and ConfigMaps
  - CI/CD pipeline integration overview
  - Scalability and resilience strategies

### 4. **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**
- A collection of documented **key design decisions** made during system evolution.  
- Each ADR includes:
  - **Context** — background and motivation  
  - **Decision** — the chosen solution  
  - **Consequences** — trade-offs and implications  
- Promotes transparency and long-term maintainability.
